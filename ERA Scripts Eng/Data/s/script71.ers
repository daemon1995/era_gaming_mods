Troops in human-player battles receive experience and new ranks directly in the battlefield.

Experience is awarded only for killing enemy units of creatures (in any way) and only the one who's killed a troop. A unit that was the direct target of attack gets experience for all losses related to this attack. Typically more experience is gained with the use of multicellular attacks, fire shield, fire wall, moat, mines, etc.

Summoned creatures do not gain experience. Also defeating clones doesn't give you any experience. Banners with a bonus to experience gives rise to the corresponding increase.
