Option 724 [Authors - Algor, Sandris]

In towns with Marketplace, Offices of the Leprechauns Bank, which issues loans to the player, are added.

For each type of loaned resources are set next individual options: rate, available amount, daily payment. Within the available amount, the player may take several loans, but the daily payment in this case may be higher.The conditions of loans are affected by the selected level of difficulty, in-game time and all players' sources of income available (towns, mines, buildings, artifacts, heroes).

If it is impossible to pay the daily payment on the loan, the Bank withholds a penalty for every under-received resource unit. If it is impossible to withhold a fine, Bank increases the rate for new loans in the form of a resource for which non-payment has occurred.

Any loan can be repaid ahead of schedule, but only in full. If the amount of early repayment is not less than half the maximum available amount on the resource, the Bank will reduce the rate.

{Attention!} The script disables the functionality of the WoG option "Bank". A "Resource Trading Center" and "Ability to transfer ALL resources" options now work only by right-clicking on the Bank button.

Option 725 [Author - Algor, Sandris (graphics)]

If there is an unused player colour, bands of renegade heroes may appear on the map, living without cities on some small territory and trading ill-gotten gains. Over time, the gangs of such "heroes" grow and they themselves get resources, experience and equipment.

AI factions prefer to recruit a hero only if they are at least level 15 or more experienced than the winning hero.

If there is a city in a gang's territory and the gang was able to capture it, all active bandits become united in a new faction and the Bounty Hunters Guild revokes all rewards for their heads. After the appearance of such a faction, new bandits will appear on the map under a different flag available and, in turn, can also capture the city on "their" territory and create a new faction.

If the player has defeated all the opponents, the bandits run away and they do not need to be killed to complete the game.
