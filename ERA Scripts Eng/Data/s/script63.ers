Option 796 [Author - Algor]

Ctrl-clicking on artifacts from the Hero screen or Heroes meeting screen to sacrifice them.

By Ctrl-clicking on Spell Scrolls the hero can get 15* <spell level> of mana points.

By Ctrl-clicking on Warlord's Banner it can reward +500 movement points that lasts over the next three days.

By Ctrl-clicking on the other artifacts, you can sacrifice it without even being at an altar, but the experience gained in this way will be half as much.

AI with a lack of mana (less than 20%) at the beginning of the day destroys the first of the scrolls in his/her backpack getting 15 * <spell level> * <DL> mana points. Also before the battle, the AI hero can destroy up to three spell scrolls.

And if there is no speed bonus, the AI uses a banner in his/her backpack getting 500 * <DL>movement points for 3 days* <DL>.

And an AI hero who is weaker than level 15, once a day sacrifices one artifact in his/her backpack that's not a Major or Relic, commander's, "empty" (new) or a part of a composite artifact.

<DL> - difficulty level bonus - 0.8/1.0/1.0/1.2/1.6/2.0.
