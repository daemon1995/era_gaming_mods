		"Option_23": "Stack size for humans:",
		"Option_23_Info": "{Stack Size for Humans}\n\nThe human stack size modifier increases the number of monsters you have to fight, but only for the human player and not for the computer player. A value of 150% means that at map start a stack of 100 neutral monsters is increased to 150 monsters. This value is multiplicative with the General Stack Size value, so if you set both values to 200%, the human player will face an 400% increased stack.\n\nNote: When used together with the {View exact  quantity} option the hint text about the monster size does not take into account the increased stack size for humans. Make right-click for the correct information.",
