A value of 150% means that at map start a stack of 100 neutral monsters is increased to 150 monsters. This value is multiplicative with the General Stack Size value, so if you set both values to 200%, the human player will face an 400% increased stack.\n\nNote: When used together with the {View exact  quantity} option the hint text about the monster size does not take into account the increased stack size for humans.
