As you already know, daemon_n released a great plugin for customizing objects - RMG_CustomizeObjectProperties, also adding new types of objects to the basic WoG mod, such as warehouses/gazebo/magic coliseum. I decided to expand this list with the following objects:

- grave
- temple of loyalty
- skeleton transformer
- watering place
- mineral spring
- hermit's shack
- junkman
- trailblazer
- ancient lamp
- observatory (including ground)
- hill fort (type 1 - does not allow upgrading creatures above level 5)

Also added a new type of object, not found in other HoMM3 mods and add-ons, but existing in HoMM4:

- dream teacher

For all objects, except for the skeleton transformer and junkman, the logic for the AI ​​is written.
Generation of any object can be customized via RMG dialog in the game or via json file in the /Lang folder.

I will be glad to any suggestions for new objects or bug reports.

Installation:
- unzip the archive into the /mods folder
