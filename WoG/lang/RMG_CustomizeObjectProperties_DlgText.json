The lists of objects preinstalled by the author of the plugin (@daemon_n) contain values that directly affect the objects created by the RMG. There are currently 4 different categories, divided by type of object:\n- {Creature Banks}: allows you to receive rewards (creatures, resources, artifacts) for defeating the object's guards, you can customize the current ones and add your own (yes, yes)\n- {Standard objects}: most standard objects for all types of soil (resource warehouses have also been added at the moment - with weekly visits)\n- {Creature Habitats}: a facility where you can hire certain creatures for a fee (like in a city).\n- {WoG-Objects}: These objects have type 63 and different subtypes. In the original, these objects are not created using the RMG, but only replace others using erm scripts, but this plugin (plugin_name) allows you to add them to the list of objects for generation (and here you clap your hands).\n\n\n{~text align=center}{Brief Help for this dialogue}}\n\nAt the bottom of the dialog there are 4 functional buttons for controlling the dialog:\n\n\n- {~>RMG_okay.def:0:0 valign=bottom} Applies the changes made to the dialog, saves it to the file \"{[Game_folder]/Runtime/RMG_CustomizeObjectsProperties.ini}\" and closes the dialog\n\n\n- {~>RMG_cncl.def:0:0 valign=bottom} {CANCELS} changes made to the dialog and closes the dialog\n\n\n- {~>RanRand.def:0:0 valign=bottom} {Changes} all values {ONLY} on the current dialog page\n\n\n- {~>RMG_dflt.def:0:0 valign=bottom} {Restores} all values {ONLY} on the current dialog page to default values (default values are stored in the game itself and the json file)\n\n\n{~text align=center}{Quick Help on generating objects on a random map}}\n\nAt the moment, the plugin is able to add to the generation list Creature Banks {(type 16)}, Sanctuaries of Thought {(types 88-90)}, Resource Warehouses {(type 142)} and WoG objects {(type 63)} - subtype you specify for them (see json file), and you can edit the value for almost any object.\n\nBasic keys for adding/editing objects:\n\n\"{RMG.objectGeneration.[type].[subtype].enabled}\" - to set the general enable/disable flag from the generation list;\n\n\"{RMG.objectGeneration.[type].[subtype].value}\" - for issuing values for new objects and editing existing ones;\n\n\"{RMG.objectGeneration.[type].[subtype].density}\" - for issuing generation density for new objects and editing existing ones;\n\n\"{RMG.objectGeneration.[type].[subtype].map}\" - for issuing the maximum number of new objects on the map and editing existing ones;\n\n\"{RMG.objectGeneration.[type].[subtype].zone}\" - for issuing the maximum number of new objects on the map and editing existing ones;\n\n\"{RMG.objectGeneration.[type].[subtype].name}\" - to set/change the object name (does not work with all objects yet);\n\n\"{RMG.objectGeneration.[type].[subtype].sound.enter}\" - to set/change the input sound played when visiting this object on the Adventure Map;\n\n\"{RMG.objectGeneration.[type].[subtype].sound.loop}\" - to set/change the cyclic sound played when you are near this object on the Adventure Map (does not work with all objects yet)\n\nYou can also ignore the [subtype] field in the json key, then the specified values will be applied to all subtypes of this object type;\n\nPlease note that the values specified in json become default for this object, therefore it is recommended to edit the values directly in the GCS settings dialog.\n\n\nBelow are short guides for specific object types.",
