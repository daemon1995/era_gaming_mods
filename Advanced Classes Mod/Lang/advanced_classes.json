Class points needed to reach master level are increased to {@Master@} and for grandmaster level to {@Grandmaster@}. As usual, each master skill gives 2 class points. For various reasons, having more than 10 secondary skills is not supported in the Advanced Classes mod.",

												Level up your magic! Using Spells in combat will make them more effective. Spell Trainer is a super fun modification which turns the use of spells and magic to a unique experience. To keep balance your Magic Strength will be reduced by 25%. There are several rules and mechanics that you need to know when playing with Spell Trainer. For example not every class has the same chance to level up spells during combat. For further information check out the help file in your mod folder.",

			"Play_Spell_Duration":				"{~red}Alternative Spell Duration{~}

												This mod uses a different formula to calculate how long spells last on creatures. A feature often asked for in the forums and implemented by {AlfwithCake}. Usually you can ignore spell duration once your spell power reaches 5 or more, which is reached after one game week.

												The new formula for spell duration is (spellpower+13)/8, rounded down.
												Collar of Conjuring gives 5 effective SP
												Ring of Conjuring gives 10 effective SP
												Cape of Conjuring gives 15 effective SP
												Ring of the Magi gives 100 effective SP

			"Play_Necro_Balancing2":			"{~red}Alternative Necromancy Balancing{~}

												One problem with Necromancy is that on very large map with big creature stacks it always gets out of control and your hero ends up with ten-thousands of skeletons, one-shotting everything and completly breaking balance and fun of the game.
												This skill was just not made with this big maps and stacks in mind, especially now that neutral stacks can grow over the limit of 4000 units. This option is my take on providing an alternative balance for Necromancy to keep balance even in later stages of the game.",

			"Play_Easier_Class":				"{~red}Easier Classes{~}

												Play with bonus class points. This option makes it easier to reach Master and Grandmaster level by providing {5} extra class points for all classes. One point is given for every two levels starting at level 20 until level 30.",

												Each class comes with distinguishing strengths and weaknesses. Can you master them all?",

			"Play_Tactics":						"{~red}Restore Tactics{~}

												If you activate this option, the Tactics skill will work as in original Heroes 3, letting you setup your troops in the Tactics phase. The bonus from Warfare is not affected and will be applied. When this option is disabled no Tactics phase will happen.",

			"Play_Commanders":					"{~red}Weaker Commanders{~}
												 
												Commanders receive only 25% of the hero's primary stats (instead of 100%) and their hit points and damage gets reduced by 25% in combat. Abilities and skills are not affected. 
												The aim of this option is to reduce the dominance of commanders in the mid to lategame and can be seen as an approach to better balance the commanders. 												
												This option is not required for the commander class system to work. It will always be enabled, regardless of the Weaker Commanders option.",												

			"Play_Diplomacy":					"{~red}Restore classic Diplomacy{~}

												Brings back the classic Diplomacy mechanic from heroes 3. Stacks will offer to join your army for money or for free.
												This option will not disable the new Diplomacy from ACM, however the price for creatures to join will be raised by +100% as a balance measure.
												Please keep in mind that other options from Difficulty or Mixed Neutral mod can change the agression level of neutral monsters, which affects the working of Diplomacy.",
