This update mostly revolves around an extended commander class and skill system, here is how it works: \nIn addition to the 9 commander base classes, 18 new promotion classes have been introduced. Making a total of 27 commander classes available. Next to the level advancement of each commander, they can also collect {Kill Counts} during combat, giving access to the new classes and increased attributes. To collect a kill count, you must finish off a stack with your commander or use the commanders native cast. When reaching 30 kill counts you are offered a promotion during combat. You can select the promotion or stay on your base class. All base classes do scale with one of the eight primary attributes, while promotion classes get a different and unique scaling. Your job is to find a good hero and commander combination to make the best out of the new system.\n\n\nAll right, now have fun!",

There are several rules and mechanics that you need to know when playing with Spell Trainer. For example not every class has the same chance to level up spells during combat. For further information check out the help file in your mod folder.",
		"Play_Spell_Duration": "{~red}Alternative Spell Duration{~}\n\nThis mod uses a different formula to calculate how long spells last on creatures. A feature often asked for in the forums and implemented by {AlfwithCake}. Usually you can ignore spell duration once your spell power reaches 5 or more, which is reached after one game week.\n\nThe new formula for spell duration is (spellpower+13)/8, rounded down.\nCollar of Conjuring gives 5 effective SP\nRing of Conjuring gives 10 effective SP\nCape of Conjuring gives 15 effective SP\nRing of the Magi gives 100 effective SP\nGrandmaster Sorcery gives extra 10 effective SP.",
		"Play_Necro_Balancing": "{~red}Alternative Necromancy Balancing{~}\n\nChoose what creatures you want to raise by right-clicking the Necromancy skill icon in your hero screen. Raising high level creatures will require Master or Grandmaster rank, it also reduces your totaly Necromancy value significantly to the given value, ignoring all additional sources of necromancy like artifacts or necro amplifier.",
		"Play_Necro_Balancing2": "{~red}Alternative Necromancy Balancing{~}\n\nOne problem with Necromancy is that on very large map with big creature stacks it always gets out of control and your hero ends up with ten-thousands of skeletons, one-shotting everything and completly breaking balance and fun of the game.\nThis skill was just not made with this big maps and stacks in mind, especially now that neutral stacks can grow over the limit of 4000 units. This option is my take on providing an alternative balance for Necromancy to keep balance even in later stages of the game.",
		"Play_Easier_Class": "{~red}Easier Classes{~}\n\nPlay with bonus class points. This option makes it easier to reach Master and Grandmaster level by providing {5} extra class points for all classes. One point is given for every two levels starting at level 20 until level 30.",
		"Play_Berserker_Mode": "{~red}Berserker Mode{~}\n\nYou want to get rid of the restrictive class system and you want to be able to level every skill up to the maximum immediately, regardless of any class? This option will allow you to learn any skill up to Grandmaster level and disable the sets of native class skills.\n\n{Balance Warning}\nbut now it's time to have some fun!\n\nAdditional game mode developed and provided by the creator of ERA: \n{~Gold}Berserker{~}",
		"Play_No_Class_Mode": "{~red}Choose Class{~}\n\nYou want to play a certain class and be more flexible with your secondary skill choices? Then activate this option to delay class selection during level up and choose a desired class when enough points are accumulated. Once you picked your class there is no way back, so choose carefully.",
		"Play_ACM_Core": "{~red}Advanced Classes{~}\n\nThe original Advanced Classes gameplay. \nChoose a career path and try to climb until you reach the top of your profession. Warrior, Mage or Adventurer, the choice is up to you! \nOnly by picking your native class skills you can accumulate enough class points to reach the highest levels. Your reward will be unique class perks and you will be able to learn all skills to the Grandmaster level. \nEach class comes with distinguishing strengths and weaknesses. Can you master them all?",
		"Play_Tactics": "{~red}Restore Tactics{~}\n\nIf you activate this option, the Tactics skill will work as in original Heroes 3, letting you setup your troops in the Tactics phase. The bonus from Warfare is not affected and will be applied. When this option is disabled no Tactics phase will happen.",
		"Play_Commanders": "{~red}Weaker Commanders{~}\n \nCommanders receive only 25% of the hero's primary stats (instead of 100%) and their hit points, damage, spell damage and passive gets reduced by 25% in combat. Abilities and skills are not affected. \nThe aim of this option is to reduce the dominance of commanders in the mid to lategame and can be seen as an approach to better balance the commanders. \nThis option is not required for the commander class system to work. It will always be enabled, regardless of the Weaker Commanders option.",
		"Play_Diplomacy": "{~red}Restore classic Diplomacy{~}\n\nBrings back the classic Diplomacy mechanic from heroes 3. Stacks will offer to join your army for money or for free.\nThis option will not disable the new Diplomacy from ACM, however the price for creatures to join will be raised by +100% as a balance measure.\nPlease keep in mind that other options from Difficulty or Mixed Neutral mod can change the agression level of neutral monsters, which affects the working of Diplomacy.",
