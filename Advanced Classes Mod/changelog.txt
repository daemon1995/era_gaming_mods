Version 1.054
- New options for Dif Mod

"AI_Recover_Losses":				"{AI Recover Losses}			
									The computer player recovers {50%} of any lost units in combat vs neutral stacks. If a unit is killed completely it will not be recovered.",	
"AI_Compensation":					"{AI Compensation}			
									To give the AI a better start each owned hero gets additional units at day one and additional units to recruit in towns. The amount of additional units depends on the option {Neutral Stack Size} and {Double Stack Size}.
									The hero only gets level 1-3 units and not if he already has above 100 units in one slot. This option helps to solve the problem that the computer was sometimes unable to defeat the big stacks that could be generated at map start. The amount of additional units is roughly the same as the Stack Size option adds units to neutral stacks.",
"AI_Useful_Spells":					"{AI Useful Spells}			
									When the Payday is reached each AI hero will get a spell book and the following spells for free: {Haste}, {Slow}, {Cure} and {Curse}",
"AI_has_no_DD":						"{AI no Dimension Door}			
									To avoid lag on big maps the Dimension Door spells for all computer players will be replaced to fly. This should reduce loading time for AI between rounds.",
