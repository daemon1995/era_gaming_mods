Your commander can have only 1 of each Warmachine in his backpack.
Each WM can be upgraded in town by right-clicking the blacksmith (Upgrades) and right-clicking the mage guild (Enchantements).

You can view the current upgrades by right-clicking on the warmachines in the hero screen or during combat.

With version 1.095, the mod introduces a new stat called Warmachine Efficiency. This new modifier increases the following parameters:
- damage of the ballista (e.g. your WM efficiency is 150% your damage will be 50% more than before)
- the damage of the first ballista shot
- heal of first aid tent during combat
- heal of first aid tent after combat
- the amount of regenerated spell points by your ammo cart (+1 SP reg for 20% efficiency)
- the health points of all your warmachines
- the damage of your castle arrow towers
- the damage of the Magic Artillery perk?, provided by Eagle Eye secondary skill

There are several sources to obtain this stat. The main source are warmachine upgrades at level 2 and level 3.

First Aid Tent:
First Aid tents now resurrect in and after combat but have a limited heal power called "Heal Capacity". Heal Capacity is shown in the bonus list and by right-clicking your tent during combat and is 2% of your total army HP + other bonuses, like skills, artifacts, WM-upgrades. This should ensure that you cannot prolong a fight until all your units are fully recovered (which was a common abuse in WoG).

Ballista:
the damage of ballista scales with your hero attack multiplied by the base damage of your ballista. So skills and artifacts increasing the base damage are very valuable to pump up your damage.

Ammo Cart:
It provides unlimited shots to your troops.
It also restores some spell points after combat and increases the damage of certain secondary skill effects. Right-Click in hero backpack for more information.
