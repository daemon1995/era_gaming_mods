Heroes Classes and Secondary Skills specialities 


In ACM there are three different hero classes and not two: Warrior, Mage and Adventurer 

Warrior and Mage class have the same chance as in vanilla H3 for secondary skills at level up. Adventurer heroes have increased chance to get offered Adventurer skills during level up, so it will be more likely to become M/GM Adventurer.
That doesn't mean you cannot play a Solmyr as a Warrior hero, just it will be less likely to get the needed secondary skills to advance to Warrior class.

Primary Skill chance at level up:

Warrior: like vanilla H3, depending on class 
Mage: like vanilla H3, depending on class but after level 15 has increased chance to get Spell Power instead of Knowledge
Adventurer: evenly distributed but influenced by faction
