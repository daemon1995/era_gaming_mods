ZVSE2

**  Updated to support experience system: 25 august 2004
**  Rewritten to improve compatiblity: Apr 2022

** "Masters of Life" v1.8 - Sir Four
**  Upgrade at te beginning of each turn
**  peasants & 1st level creatures of the same town that hero
**  into upgraded 1st level creatures of that town
**  in all hero armies (except Necromancers)

** Modified by Thomas Franz (samot) 19.10.04
** - rewrote the upgrade-routine to work with Extension Heroes
** - do not upgrade if Town=Conflux and Neutral Town is active,
**   otherwise it would upgrade the shooting Halflings to not shooting Rogues
** - set the costs of Halflings and Rogues equal if Neutral town is active to give
**   the same changes to the Neutral town

** Rewritten by Archer30 Apr 2022
** - Used faster looping method

** To use this code, put it into a Global Event, set to never happen.
