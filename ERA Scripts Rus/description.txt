General:

Era Scripts is a mod/script-pack that adds many additional features/options to the game.
New options are on the last two tabs of the "WoG Options" menu.

Requirements and recommendations:
To run the mod requires Era platform version 3 or newer. The mod works on top of the basic WoG mod, full compatibility with other mods (except those that change graphics/interface elements) is not guaranteed.

The mod, especially ReMagic mod option, would possibly prohibit from completion some custom WoG or SoD maps, because of the Town Portal modified spell, so in that case you can disable ReMagic option.

Attention! This is the Russian version of the mod.
